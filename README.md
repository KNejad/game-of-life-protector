# game-of-life-protector
A game based on Conway's game of life, where the objective is to keep the 4 blocks in the center alive.

Rules: 
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Each generation you can alter the state of 1 block. If any of the 4 central blocks die you lose! Each generation that pases earns you 1 point
