# game-of-life-protector
A game based on Conway's game of life, where the objective is to keep the 4 blocks in the center alive.<br>

Rules: <br>
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.<br>
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.<br>
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br>

Each generation you can alter the state of 1 block. If any of the 4 central blocks die you lose! Each generation that pases earns you 1 point.
